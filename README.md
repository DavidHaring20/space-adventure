# creative-code-exam-project
This is a repository for my Project exam in Creative code.
So far I have created simple rendering system that will render different object. Because of tight schedule i could only build as much.
Ideas to make project more worthy:
    - Event listeners so user can impact animation in following ways:
        - Left arrow - it will slowly change (each time it is pressed) movement of the objects to the   left so the user get's the feeling that he turned his head to the left 
        - Right arrow - it will slowly change (each time it is pressed) movement of the objects to the  right so the user get's the feeling that he turned his head to the right
        - Up arrow - it will slowly increase the speed of the objects so the user get's the impression that he is speeding up
        - Down arrow - it will slowly decrease the speed of the objects so the user get's the impression that he is slowing down 

    - Different behaviour depending on different objects:
        - Each object(except stars) would be of some x and y size and during short period it would enlarge so the user get's the impression he is moving towards the object
        - Black holes could produce some lighting
        - Asteroids could spin 
        - Alien ships could briefly dissapear and re-apear again

    - Music
        - Put on some space-y music so the user get's even more impression he is floating through space
